It runs on Linux, or Mac. On Windows, you can run it through the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Here is a walk-through of the procedure and troubleshooting of frequent issues. Lesion delineation should already be done (e.g. on ITK snap, a wonderful open source software that allows to draw simulatenously on multiple scanning modalities), and you should have your binary lesion masks.\n","\n","Lesion delineation for stroke: on ITK snap, you can use the semi-automated delineation where you feed samples of white matter, gray matter, CSF, and lesioned tissue and grow bubbles inside the lesion to build a 3D model.\n","\n","Lesion delineation for TBI: don't even bother with semi-automated tools for complex lesions. manually draw them on each slice, and interpolate to build the 3D model.\n","\n","A quick note on multimodal lesion delineation: better to draw on T1, even if you're looking at the FLAIR/SWI window predominantly.
